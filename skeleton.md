1. Pick the class from which the tool was taught
2. Pick the tool you need
3. Enter the mandatory parameters

Module STATS_DEGREE 

    Automater: What do you want to do?
    task = dropdown(["predict the future with frequentist statistics", 
        "find whether two things differ",
        "take a stroll by the bayesian"
        ])

        print the distribution matrix
